= Adding kubedock to run containers in the UDI

With this update, link:https://github.com/joyrex2001/[kubedock] is now a part of the UDI ({prod-short} default image). If the environment variable `KUBEDOCK_ENABLED` is set to `true` in a workspace (this can be done using a devfile), the kubedock server is started at startup.

When `KUBEDOCK_ENABLED=true` then the following commands will be executed with kubedock. The remaining commands, in particular, `podman build`, will be executed by the local Podman:

* `podman run`
* `podman ps`
* `podman exec`
* `podman cp`
* `podman logs`
* `podman inspect`
* `podman kill`
* `podman rm`
* `podman wait`
* `podman stop`
* `podman start`
